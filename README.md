Fetch initial data and build application state
Build initial interface from application state
Set up all event listeners for interface
Event listeners might transform interaction into API requests (THIS IS NEW)
User interaction triggers event listeners, which in turn update data in multiple places:
Pass update requests to API (THIS IS NEW)
API returns success or failure for update
On success, update state to reflect change
On failure, render useful error message to user
React Re-renders components based on updated state
